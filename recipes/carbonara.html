            <li>Pancetta (you can use bacon instead)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Two cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>

            <li>Butter (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a generous amount of salt to a pot filled with
                water and bring it to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Add your spaghetti to the water, close the lid (if you
                have one) and let them sit until the water boils again.
                After that, switch to medium heat and stir ocasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Add two smashed cloves of garlic and the diced pancetta
                to a pan with a tablespoon of olive oil and let it cook
                at medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>Once the garlic is brown, remove it - and give yourself a 
                chef's treat, if you want ;)</li>
            <li>For the sauce, throw a whole egg, three egg yolks and grated
                parmesan cheese into a bowl. Add a pinch of pepper and a pinch
                of salt and mix it all.
            </li>
            <li>Once the pancetta has a decent color, add the pasta to the pan
                with a good amount of pasta water and remove the pan from the 
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the sauce to the pan, and, optionally, a tablespoon
                of butter for more creaminess. Mix it all.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, present the dish with some more parmesan cheese
                and pepper on top, and you're done!
            </li>
        </ol>
